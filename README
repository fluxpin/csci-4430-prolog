My solutions to two ProgLang problems. Written in Prolog.

**Flu Simulation (flu-sim.pl)**

The predicate

    infect(X, Y, Path).

returns a path where X infects Y because X was defined as sick or infected
by some student defined as sick.

**Natural Language Parsing (nlp.pl)**

The predicates

    repl.
    repl(State).

start the natural language interface. The former uses the line specified in
the assignment, the latter substitutes an arbitrary line. Students MUST
have unique names.

The natural language interface understands:

    Switch X with Y.

        Swap adjacent students.

    Where is X in line?

        Locate a student.

    What is the current order of the line?

        Print the line.
